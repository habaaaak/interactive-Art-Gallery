Interactive Image Display Assignment

This project is a school coding assignment designed to demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web page. The page features a collection of images that dynamically appear or disappear based on user interactions with buttons.

Key Features:

Interactive Buttons: Users can click, hover, or double-click buttons to trigger specific actions.
Dynamic Image Display: Each button controls the visibility of a corresponding image, allowing users to hide or show images dynamically.
Responsive Design: The page is designed to be responsive and works seamlessly across different devices.
How It Works:

Button Actions:
Click: Hides or shows specific images.
Hover: Displays images when the mouse hovers over a button.
Double-Click: Reveals additional images or resets the display.
JavaScript Event Handling: The page uses JavaScript event listeners (onclick, onmouseover, ondblclick, etc.) to manage user interactions and update the DOM dynamically.
CSS Styling: Images are initially hidden using CSS, and their visibility is toggled based on user input.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and initial visibility control of images.
JavaScript: Logic for handling button interactions and dynamically updating the page.

How to Use:
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Interact with the buttons to hide or show the corresponding images.
